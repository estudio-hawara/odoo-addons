<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<h3 id="generators">Generators</h3>

<p>
  Once the addon is installed, you&#39;ll find a new
  <strong>Faker</strong> option in your menu. That option will let you define
  your own <strong>Generators</strong>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  Each of your generators will target a model from your Odoo database. You can
  create as many generators as you want. For every generator, you can define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    a <strong>name</strong> (like <em>Corporations from the United Kingdom</em>)
  </li>
  <li>a <strong>model</strong> (like <em>Contact</em>)</li>
  <li>
    a default <strong>locale</strong> to be used when generating fake data
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="generator-fields">Generator fields</h3>

<p>
  To make your generators useful, you have to define its fields. The fields
  available are literally the stored fields of the corresponding model.
</p>

<p>
  The information that you can set for each field depends on the type of field,
  which can be one of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Constant</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Faker</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Random record</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Generated rows</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="constant">Constant</h4>

<p>
  When adding fields of type <strong>Constant</strong> you will only be able to
  set one thing: its (constant) value.
</p>

<p>
  You will use constant fields when you want all the generated records to have
  the same value.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    For instance, if you want to generate active contacts, you can set its
    <em>active</em> field to <em>True</em>.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="faker">Faker</h4>

<p>
  The <strong>Faker</strong> type is meant to be used for fields where you want
  a different value to be created each time, like names, emails, phones,
  addresses, account numbers, etc.
</p>

<p>
  The values are generated by Python&#39;s
  <a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io">Faker</a>, so check out their
  documentation. Most of its methods are available. Feel free to open an issue
  if you need or want one of the methods that aren&#39;t currently available.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    By default, each new faker Field inherits the locale from its parent
    generator but you can choose a different one. Make the
    <strong>Faker locale</strong> column visible to be able to view and edit its
    value.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="random-record">Random record</h4>

<p>
  If your model has a many to one field (like the country of a contact) you can
  set its type <strong>Random record</strong> so one different record from the
  related table will be used each time.
</p>

<h4 id="generated-rows">Generated rows</h4>

<p>
  If your model has a one to many relationship (like the lines of an order) you
  can set its type to <strong>Generated rows</strong> and use the
  <strong>Row generator</strong> column to select a related generator created
  specifically to define the child rows.
</p>

<h3 id="generator-wizard">Generator wizard</h3>

<p>
  Once you have defined your generator, you can use the
  <strong>Generate</strong> header button to run a wizard where you can define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>generator</strong> that you want to use</li>
  <li>the <strong>number of records</strong> that you want to generate</li>
  <li>a maximum number of errors to tolerate before aborting</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>

<p>
  This addon depends on Python&#39;s
  <a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io">Faker</a> package for the generation of
  random data. Make sure to install it before enabling the addon.
